Markdown Collaboration Tool

### About

I'd like this to be a tool build by a community for a community.

### Get started

1. `npm install && npm start`
2. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.

### Ideas

- Sharable (publicly or privately)
- Post to Medium, etc.
- Word count, read time, character count
- Comments
- Suggested changes (similar to Google Docs)
- Non-distruction mode

Feel free to contribute!
