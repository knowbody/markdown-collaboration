### About

I'd like this to be community build collaboration tool. Something like Google Docs but for markdown.

### Get started

1. `npm install && npm start`
2. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.

### Ideas

- [] Sharable (publicly or privately)
- [] Post to Medium, etc.
- [x] Word count, read time
- [] Comments
- [] Suggested changes (similar to Google Docs)
- [] Non-distruction mode

Feel free to contribute!
